h1. Google Analytics integration

{toc}

h1. Configuration

Add the following lines in your application.conf :

bc. plui.googleanalytics.account=<YOUR GOOGLE ANALYTICS TRACKING CODE>

If no tracking code is defined, the tracker is desactivated

bc. plui.googleanalytics.indev=false

Do you want to have the Google Analytics tracker in Play DEV mode ?


h1. Macro google-analytics.js

Put the following macro just before the </body> html element (in your mail.html template for exemple)

bc. ...
    #{google-analytics.js /}
</body>

if the Google Analytics tracking code is defined in the application.conf, the javascript tracker is injected into the page.
